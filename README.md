# PDME - NFC/Side-Channel Attack

Project description:
> IoT devices are becoming ubiquitous in the world, and some use NFC for communication. With the objective to re-enforce the lab capabilities, we aim to study/analyze the feasibility of side-channel attacks against such devices.
> 
> As a first step, it will be necessary to develop an adequate setup to communicate and to collect data (leakage) via the NFC layer (according to the RF protocol supported).
> 
> As a second step, a side-channel attack will focus on the IoT NFC tag and, if possible, use a Deep Machine Learning method to target confidentiality or authenticity security features.
